## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of the **condition** expression in the `for` and `while` loops?

The condition expression tells when to stop the loop

- When is the first expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **initialization**) evaluated?

the initialization is evaluated once when the for loop begins

- When is the second expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **condition**) evaluated?

the condition is evaluated before each iteration of the loop begins

- When is the third expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **final expression**) evaluated?

the final expression is evaluated after each iteration of the loop ends

- What is the purpose of the **final expression** in a `for` loop?

the final expression typically changes the value that is evaluated in the condition, so that the loop eventually ends. Otherwise, the loop may be infinite
